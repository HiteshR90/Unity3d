Get access through playerProperties for items

playerGameObject - get object with player tag
hudGameObject 	 - get object with hud tag

In order for the player to find objects we need the objects to check for a Trigger event
- objects will look for anything tagged - collisionBoxBody

if they find the player, then we need to set the players 


Create a few functions to use for the itemPickup
ApplyPickup ( player status ) - we need to apply the pickup type to the player
