/*
Player Properties - Set and store pickups and state of player 

Mario has different states: MarioDead, MarioSmall, MarioLarge, MarioFire													

We need a starting State for mario:

// playerState = PlayerState.MarioSmall;								

Mario will need to do and have the following properties:
	lives
	keys (optional)
	coins
	projectileFire
	sockets left / right to shoot fireballs from
	material/texture swaps for mario (standard and fire)
	need a change state option and fire option

Ability to set number for coin extra life  

In the update, we need to get the player controls for last movement direction to know which way to shoot the fireballs (left/right socket)

Functions:
	AddKeys
	AddCoin
	SetPlayerState - from enum above

And let's add an AddComponentMenu this time around
